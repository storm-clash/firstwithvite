    useState() = Re-renders the component when the state value changes.

    useRef() = "use reference" Does not cause re-renders when its value changes.
                When you want a component to "remember" some information
                but you don't want that information to trigger new renders.


                1. Accessing/Interacting with the DOM elements.
                2. Handling focus, animations and transitions
                3. Managing timers and intervals.
